# react-native-commons

## Installation

    npm install @indec/react-native-commons

## Development

The `npm link` doesn't work because `react-native` [doesn't support symlinks](https://github.com/facebook/metro/issues/1). For local testing add the modified package to your project using the following command:

    npm add /path/to/react-native-commons

or via yarn:

    yarn add file:/path/to/react-native-commons
